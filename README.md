ðŸ§© AI Maze Solver
An AI-powered maze solver that generates a maze as a CSV file and finds the shortest path using A (A-Star), DFS (Depth-First Search), and BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithms*.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Maze Generation: Creates a maze and stores it in a CSV file.
âœ… Pathfinding Algorithms: Implements A*, DFS, and BFS to find the shortest path.
âœ… Visualization: Uses Pygame to display the maze and highlight the path found.
âœ… Interactive Interface: Allows users to generate new mazes and solve them with different algorithms.
